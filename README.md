# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
A company by the name of Pewlett Hackard is facing an issue where there will soon be a mass wave of retirements due to a large population of their company approaching the age of retirement. The company had provided a large amount of data regarding the departments and the employees that work there. This analysis focuses on said data to provide information on the retiring employees per title and which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 
## Results
### Major Points
A few major points can be drawn from the retiring employees by title and the employees eligible for the mentorship program.
* A majority of the retiring employees will be senior level engineers and senior level staff. 
* Out of the five departments managers, two of them are part of the retiring employees list.

* There are a total of 1549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
* There is a much greater number of employees in the retirement range than there are employees eligible to be in the mentorship program.
## Summary 
### Major Takeaways
From the analysis conducted, there are a total of 72,458 employees who fall into the retiring employees category. Only 1,549 employees are qualified to mentor the next generation of employees. On average, each of these employees who would take place in the mentorship program would have to train 47 employees to fill the vacancies that are soon to happen. It would be wise to enlarge the critera for those eligible for the mentorship program. A new query could be made which would include a greater age range for this program so that there will be more mentors to help train other employees to fill the future vacanies. The company had also provided information on all of the employee salaries. A new table could be made with the salaries of the retiring employees. This would give insight onto the future budget of the company once these employees retire. This future budget could be used on hiring new employees who wouldn't necessarily have as high as a salary as a retiring employee. This would leave more funds for the company to be spent on other areas.
